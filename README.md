# ðŸŽˆ Blank app template

A simple Streamlit app template for you to modify!

[![Open in Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://blank-app-template.streamlit.app/)

Clicking the badge will open the hosted version of this project so you can try
the spreadsheet-style table without installing anything locally.

### How to run it on your own machine

1. Install the requirements

   ```
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the app

   ```
   $ streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```

### Using the spreadsheet feature

The app now displays an editable table powered by `st-aggrid`. Update the
cells directly in your browser and click **Save to CSV** to write the results
to `tasks.csv`.

To launch the web-hosted version immediately, click the **Open in Streamlit**
badge near the top of this README.
